Darl Test page
====


This offers a means to test Darl code without having to create a form. Unlike the forms tester, where the data is presented in sequence and the forms engine calculats the next required values, the Darl test page expects all the data items to be present, and performs a single pass through the Darl interpreter.
This is the same process as when using the Darl API app. 

The page reads the rule set, determines the number and range of inputs, supplies default values where appropriate and presents a set of controls to enter test values.
