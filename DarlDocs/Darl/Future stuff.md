# Natural language interface

DARL is a very simple language, but it is still something you have to learn, with a grammar you have to keep to.

It's logical to use AI to create AI, and we are fast completing a Natural Language interface that will enable you to describe relationships in free form.
This will try to detect rules of any form in text, isolate variables that are inputs and outputs, and automatically infer their type.
We will use a kind of conversational interface. After you've input your rules the system will ask for clarification where needed and concrete examples.

# Creating RuleSets directly from Data

We created this ability before we created Darl. In fact Darl was originally conceived as a way of representing a Machine Learning model.
We will be looking at integrating our existing supervised learning fuzzy logic rule induction algorithm with Azure's Machine learning facilities.
